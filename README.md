# Telemetry

This extension collects telemetry data to help us build a better experience for
using VS Code with Home Assistant. We use [vscode-extension-telemetry](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-telemetry),
which reports the following data:

- Extension name
- Extension version
- Machine ID and session ID from VS Code
- Operating system
- Platform version

Additionally, if the language server fails to activate, we report the diagnostic
data the language server produces. The extension respects the `telemetry.enableTelemetry`
setting, which you can learn more about at VS Code's
[telemetry FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).
